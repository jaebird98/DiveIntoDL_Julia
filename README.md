# DiveIntoDL_julia

This repository is a Julian implementation of the book "Dive into deep learning". See [here](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en).

This project aims to translate the book to use Julia and Flux.jl accompanied by terse but complete explanation.
While someone familiar with julia and DL should be able understand this project without too much hassle, it is recommended to peruse it along the original material.

This project is written in Pluto. It is a reactive notebook, hence the structure of the code or name of the variables may change accordingly.
